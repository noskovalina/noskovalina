### Hi there 👋 
I am Alina, MSc in Data Science at the Higher School of Economics. I am actively studying programming and applied mathematics and am currently looking for an internship or position as a Data Scientist.
Possessing an analytical mindset, I enjoy step-by-step solutions to complex problems; I have successful experience in scientific research and in the effective management of a student team.

## Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/noskovalina/Classification_algorithm/blob/main/Classification%20algorithm.ipynb">Classification algorithm</a>
In this project, a classification algorithm based on probabilistic models was developed. The data for the project is a set of texts in English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Polish and Portuguese.


### <a href="https://github.com/noskovalina/MCMC_decoder/blob/main/MCMC%20decoder.ipynb">MCMC decoder</a>
This project implements a text decoder based on the MCMC algorithm (Markov Chain Monte Carlo).


### <a href="https://github.com/noskovalina/MNIST_Digit_Recognition/blob/main/MNIST%20Digit%20Recognition.ipynb">Digit Recognition</a>
In this project, an image classification algorithm was written using singular value decomposition and SVM. For this purpose, the MNIST number set was used, where the training data consists of images of digits, and the target value is the digit itself.
